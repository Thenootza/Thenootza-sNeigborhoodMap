# Description of the Neighborhood Map Project
It's a project made within the FEND Google Developer Nanodegree Scholarship, the final project actually.
The project consists in adding a full-screen map (of the sites I want to visit some day) to the page using the Google Maps API.
This project was written using React and allows the user to search through the places displayed on a list under the search input field.   

## Get Started
1. Download or clone this repository (Use '$ git clone https://github.com/Thenootza/Thenootza-sNeigborhoodMap.git' command on the git bash window opened from the folder you want to clone the repository to).
2. If you download the repository: unzip the folder.
3. Open Command Prompt on your desktop (for Windows 10: on your lower-left corner of your desktop, on the search bar, type 'cmd' and hit 'return').
4. Use 'cd' to enter into the cloned or downloaded repository ('cd "folder_name"').
5. Install dependencies using this commands:
  - npm install
  - npm start
6. The app should open in your browser (http://localhost:3000/).

## Dependencies
1. To display the map I have used Google Map API by obtaining an API key from here [Get API Key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
2. And for the information displayed on the marker's info-windows (added in this project) on the map I used [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API:Main_page)

## Contribution
1. Make sure somebody else isn't already working on the idea you might have to improve the app, by asking me on GitHub.
2. Fork and clone the repository.
3. Make sure you add and commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to the repository.
5. Thank you!
